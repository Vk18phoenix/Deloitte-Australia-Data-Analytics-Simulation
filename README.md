## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### **Task 1 â€” Data Analysis & Dashboard Creation**
- Designed a Tableau dashboard integrating four views:
  1. Factory vs. Unhealthy Device Counts  
  2. Device Type vs. Unhealthy Counts  
  3. Factory distribution by color-coded KPI  
  4. Geographic map showing production sites with KPI indicators
- Implemented dashboard-level filters so selecting one element updates all charts simultaneously.

### **Task 2 â€” Forensic Technology Equality Classification**
- Worked with a dataset containing **Factory**, **Job Role**, and **Equality Score**.
- Created a 4th column (**Equality Class**) using Excel formulas to categorize scores into Fair, Unfair, and Highly Discriminative.
- Applied auto-fill techniques to classify the entire dataset efficiently and accurately.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- Certain factories had significantly higher **unhealthy device counts** compared to others.  
- Patterns in equality scores revealed potential **gender pay discrepancies** in specific job roles.  
- Geographic mapping pinpointed locations contributing most to inequality and device issues.  
- Created a **single dashboard view** enabling stakeholders to interactively explore all metrics.

## ðŸš€ Outcome
This simulation strengthened my capabilities in:
- Business-focused data analysis
- Best practices in data visualization using Tableau
- Logical classification and automation in Excel
- Translating raw data into actionable business insights
