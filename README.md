## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Demonstrated

| Tool / Skill | Application |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Tableau** | Built an interactive multi-view dashboard, applied filters, used calculated fields, and visualized KPIs clearly. |
| **Excel** | Applied conditional formulas, automated classification logic, and cleaned datasets. |
| **Data Cleaning** | Removed inconsistencies, organized data for analysis. |
| **Data Visualization** | Used multiple chart types, color coding, and interactive filters to make insights intuitive. |
| **Analytical Thinking** | Identified key trends and patterns from raw datasets. |

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

**Task 1 â€” Data Analysis & Dashboard Creation**  
- Designed a Tableau dashboard integrating four different sheets:
  1. Factory vs. Unhealthy Device Counts
  2. Device Type vs. Unhealthy Counts
  3. Factory Distribution by Color-coded KPI
  4. Geographic map showing production sites with KPI color indicators  
- Implemented dashboard-level filters so selecting one element updates all charts simultaneously.

**Task 2 â€” Forensic Technology Equality Classification**  
- Worked with a dataset containing **Factory**, **Job Role**, and **Equality Score**.
- Created a 4th column (**Equality Class**) using Excel formulas to categorize scores into Fair, Unfair, and Highly Discriminative.
- Applied auto-fill techniques to classify the entire dataset accurately.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- Identified certain factories with significantly higher **unhealthy device counts** compared to others.  
- Detected patterns in equality scores indicating potential **gender pay discrepancies** in specific job roles.  
- Visualized data geographically to pinpoint locations contributing most to inequality and device issues.  
- Created a **single dashboard view** enabling stakeholders to interactively explore all metrics.
