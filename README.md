# Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Simulation (August 2025)

This repository showcases my completed work for the **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation** hosted on Forage.  
The project involved working with real-world style datasets, performing analytical tasks in Excel, and building a professional dashboard in Tableau to deliver clear, actionable insights.

- **`Equality_Table_Completed.xlsx`**  
  Processed Excel file classifying **Equality Scores** into:
  - **Fair** (score between -10 and +10)
  - **Unfair** (score between -20 and -10 or between 10 and 20)
  - **Highly Discriminative** (score below -20 or above 20)  
  The classification was automated using custom conditional formulas.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Demonstrated

| Tool / Skill | Application |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Tableau** | Built an interactive multi-view dashboard, applied filters, used calculated fields, and visualized KPIs clearly. |
| **Excel** | Applied conditional formulas, automated classification logic, and cleaned datasets. |
| **Data Cleaning** | Removed inconsistencies, organized data for analysis. |
| **Data Visualization** | Used multiple chart types, color coding, and interactive filters to make insights intuitive. |
| **Analytical Thinking** | Identified key trends and patterns from raw datasets. |

## 📊 Project Overview

**Task 1 — Data Analysis & Dashboard Creation**  
- Designed a Tableau dashboard integrating four different sheets:
  1. Factory vs. Unhealthy Device Counts
  2. Device Type vs. Unhealthy Counts
  3. Factory Distribution by Color-coded KPI
  4. Geographic map showing production sites with KPI color indicators  
- Implemented dashboard-level filters so selecting one element updates all charts simultaneously.

**Task 2 — Forensic Technology Equality Classification**  
- Worked with a dataset containing **Factory**, **Job Role**, and **Equality Score**.
- Created a 4th column (**Equality Class**) using Excel formulas to categorize scores into Fair, Unfair, and Highly Discriminative.
- Applied auto-fill techniques to classify the entire dataset accurately.

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified certain factories with significantly higher **unhealthy device counts** compared to others.  
- Detected patterns in equality scores indicating potential **gender pay discrepancies** in specific job roles.  
- Visualized data geographically to pinpoint locations contributing most to inequality and device issues.  
- Created a **single dashboard view** enabling stakeholders to interactively explore all metrics.

## 🚀 Outcome

The completed simulation strengthened my skills in:
- Business-focused data analysis
- Visualization best practices in Tableau
- Logical classification and automation in Excel
- Translating raw data into actionable business insights
